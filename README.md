## 🔥 Why this looks “fancy” (high-level design tricks)

This version uses:

✔ Centered hero section (elite profiles do this)
✔ Visual hierarchy (big title → specializations → content)
✔ Minimal text, high signal
✔ Clean emoji usage (not cluttered)
✔ Recruiter-friendly scanning
✔ AI-engineer branding instead of developer branding
